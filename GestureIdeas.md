# Gestures
## Numbers
### Digit : flat hand, fingers spread
* Signals a digit to be appended to the current (possibly not yet existant) number
* The next gesture will give the digit's value. 
* The values will be based on raised fingers for each 1 in the binary expansion of the digit.  
* negate number : L shape of hand, fingers pointing down
* End:number
## Control
### Start: thumb out to side
### End: fist with palm down
### Repeat : ok sign, loop parallel to sensor
* x number of times
* thing to repeat x times
### timeout

## Macros
### Record : Pinky out
* pick number
* Start:record 
* End:record

### Reference : thumb and pinky out, other fingers curled

## Movements  
### Pitch : fingers together, pointing up @ 45 degrees
* Forward/Backward (pitch x degrees, hold for y seconds)  
### Roll : hand facing so thumb is lowest finger, fingers together pointing away from user
* Strafe left/right (roll x degrees, hold for y seconds)
### Yaw : index finger out, pointing 45 degrees right from sensor short axis
* turn angle (x degrees counterclockwise)
### Thrust : "rock on" sign with index and pinky along sensor short axis, thumb on long axis
* change thrust (pos/neg number parameter)
* up/down

## Run: "peace sign" with palm down, fingers along short sensor axis
