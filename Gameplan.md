# Setup leap motion  
   *see what output is available  
   *see what gestures are actually recongizable  
# Develop language  
   *Determine commands we want to run  
   *Determine gestures that build those commands  
   *Determine gesture syntax  
# Train classifier based on data (svm should be fine)  
   *Collect training data for Leap output of each gesture  
   *train SVM on data,  
   *Test classifier, modify as necessary  
# Check in with Prof Sattar  
# Determine RPYTT vectors for each complex command  
# Implement Leap to Gesture node  
# Implement Interpret Node  
# Implement Compiler Node  
# Implement Run Node  
# Test
