-Setup leap motion
	-see what output is available
	-see what gestures are actually recongizable
-Develop language
	-Determine commands we want to run
	-Determine gestures that build those commands
	-Determine gesture syntax
-Check in with Prof Sattar
-Determine RPYTT vectors for each complex command
-Collect training data for Leap output of each gesture
	-Train classifier based on data (svm should be fine)
	-Test classifier, modify as necessary
-Implement Leap to Gesture node
-Implement Interpret Node
-Implement Compiler Node
-Implement Run Node
-Test
